	Joins SYM.NAME to Hub_Address on address info to connect address to ADDRESS_SQN. Joins with Hub_Account
	on Account # and Ordinal to connect ACCT_SQN.

	Hub_Addresses only contains addresses of accounts with ordinal = 0, but WHERE ORDINAL = 0
	is needed here as well, otherwise we get more than one address for an account, if there is an address
	associated with a joint on an account and also associated with a primary on a separate account.
