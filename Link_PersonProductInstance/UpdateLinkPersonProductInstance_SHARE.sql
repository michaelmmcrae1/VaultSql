	Updates Link_Person_ProductInstance from SYM.SAVINGSNAME. Connects Share Product instances with a Person.
	This script only connects non-primary members to the Share, it does not also connect the primary account
	holder's SSN to the share.

	Currently, this is connecting beneficiaries, any/all types of connection to a share. Maybe it should only be
	connecting certain kinds of connected people? (i.e. joint, spouse, etc.)
